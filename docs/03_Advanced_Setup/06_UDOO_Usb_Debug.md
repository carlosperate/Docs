## Introduction

UDOO features a built in USB to serial interface which is very useful for various reasons: You can use it to connect UDOO via SSH without a network connection, programming the Sam3x (arduino) and access the debug console for troubleshooting purposes.

Connecting via serial will practically result in a shell console, the same as the one you’ll obtain through [SSH connection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell).

Note: Be sure the jumper J18 (the one near the UDOO reset button) is plugged to access to the debug console.

## Windows

Download the serial adapter Driver [here](http://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/pages/usbtouartbridgevcpdrivers.aspx). Install the proper version for your Operating System:

* CP210xVCPInstaller_x86.exe for 32-bit systems

* CP210xVCPInstaller_x64.exe for 64-bit system

Download and install [Putty](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html). Open putty and configure it as follows:

* Connection type “serial”

* Port: “COM3” (please note that this value may be different)

* Speed: “115200”

Save it as “Udoo-serial” for future uses.

Connect the serial port of UDOO (CN6) to your PC using the micro USB cable.

Power up UDOO.

Click Open.

Done!

You’re in! You’ll be able to see the startup process and access to the remote shell console on UDOO.

## Linux

Connect the serial port of UDOO (CN6) to your PC using the micro USB cable.
Type:

```bash

dmesg

```

You should see this line at the end:

```bash

usb 2-2.1: cp21x converter now attached to tty

```

Install minicom:

```bash

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install minicom

```

Open Minicom and configure it (only the first time) using the following command:

```bash

sudo minicom -sw

```

Go to “Serial port setup” and edit as follow:

```bash

Serial Device: /dev/ttyUSB0 (type a key)
Hardware Flow Control: No (type f key)
Software Flow Control: No (type g key)

```

Press exit and “Save setup as dfl”.

Exit from Minicom.

Let’s give proper access permissions to serial port with:

```bash

sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB0

```

Now we can start listening with:

```bash

sudo minicom -w

```

Power cycle UDOO to see the boot process and connect it to serial console shell.


## Mac OS X

Download the serial adapter Driver [here](http://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/pages/usbtouartbridgevcpdrivers.aspx).

Connect the serial port of UDOO (CN6) to your PC using the micro USB cable.

Download and install [Serial Tools](https://itunes.apple.com/it/app/serialtools/id611021963), available also at apple store.

Open Serial Tools and change the following parameters:

```bash

sudo minicom -w

```

Hit connect, and here you go!
